# Model Interpretability Explorer

Welcome to the **Interpretability** — a collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating practical tools and techniques for understanding machine learning models.

This repository is designed to help data scientists, machine learning engineers, and curious practitioners explore and compare different interpretability methods through hands-on examples and visualizations.

## Contents

### 1. `Partial_Dependence_Plots.ipynb`
- **Goal**: Visualize and interpret the global effect of input features on model predictions using **Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)**.
- **Dataset**: California Housing Dataset (from `sklearn.datasets`)
- **Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Highlights**:
  - 1D and 2D PDP visualizations
  - Insights into marginal effects and potential feature interactions
  - Discussion of assumptions and limitations of PDPs

### 2. `Individual_Conditional_Expectation.ipynb`
- **Goal**: Visualize and interpret the individual effects of input features on model predictions using **Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots**.
- **Dataset**: California Housing Dataset (from `sklearn.datasets`)
- **Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Highlights**:
  - ICE and PDP visualizations
  - Insights into contrast between PDP and ICE plots

### Coming Soon
- `Accumulated_Local_Effects.ipynb` – ALE plots to address feature correlation biases
- `Shap_Values.ipynb` – SHAP for local + global model explanations
- `Lime_Explanations.ipynb` – LIME for interpreting individual predictions
- `Counterfactual_Explanations.ipynb` – "What-if" explanations for model decision boundaries

## Purpose

Model interpretability is essential for:
- **Building trust** in machine learning applications
- **Debugging** model behavior
- Ensuring **fairness, accountability, and transparency**

This repo aims to provide a practical starting point for exploring the strengths, limitations, and use cases of popular interpretability techniques.
